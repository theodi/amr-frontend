		<p>The threat caused by antimicrobial resistance
		(AMR) is a growing and urgent global health problem. Currently up to
		700,000 people globally, including 50,000 people in Europe and the USA,
		die each year due to drug resistance in illnesses such as bacterial
		infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.</p>
		<p>In 2016, a number of pharmaceutical companies signed two declarations,
		committing to sharing surveillance data to make it accessible to public
		health bodies and healthcare professionals.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Davos declaration (January 2016)</li>
			<li>The United Nations Global Assembly Declaration (September 2016)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is an accepted need to share data form the global antibiotic
		surveillance studies externally to guide appropriate antibiotic prescription,
		to set up new breakpoints for antibiotics and to encourage wider innovation
		in this area.</p>
