				<p>This Wellcome-ODI pilot project focused on gathering and openly publishing data on AMR surveillance programs.  Wellcome and <a href="https://vivli.org/vivli-awarded-contract-to-improve-access-to-antimicrobial-resistance-surveillance-data/">Vivli</a> are working on a <a href="https://amr.vivli.org">new website</a> that aims to improve the access and research use of AMR surveillance data</p>

			<p>The threat caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing and urgent
				global health problem. Currently, up to 700,000 people globally, including
				50,000 people in Europe and the USA, die each year due to drug resistance in
				illnesses such as bacterial infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.</p>
			<p>In 2016, a number of pharmaceutical companies signed two declarations,
				committing to sharing surveillance data to make it accessible to public
				health bodies and healthcare professionals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <a
					href="https://www.ifpma.org/partners-2/declaration-by-the-pharmaceutical-biotechnology-and-diagnostics-industries-on-combating-antimicrobial-resist"
					target="_blank">
					Davos declaration</a> (January 2016)
				</li>
				<li>The <a
					href="https://www.un.org/pga/71/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2016/09/DGACM_GAEAD_ESCAB-AMR-Draft-Political-Declaration-1616108E.pdf"
					target="_blank">
					United Nations Global Assembly Declaration</a> (September 2016)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is a need to share data from the global antibiotic surveillance
				studies more broadly. This will improve the understanding on resistance
				trends, inform appropriate antibiotic and vaccines use and encourage wider
				innovation in this important area of public health.</p>
			<p>Why are surveillance data important?</p>
			<p>Surveillance enables the assessment of incidence rates of resistance to
				various antibiotics globally, nationally, regionally, and at the hospital-level.
				Data can also be used to understand gaps and guide research efforts to develop
				new products to address these gaps.</p>
			<h2>About the initiative</h2>
			<p>This initiative, grant-funded by Wellcome's Drug-Resistant Infections
				Priority Programme, is a pilot project focused on gathering and openly
				publishing data on industry sponsored human antimicrobial surveillance
				programmes.</p>
			<p>With the active participation from leading pharmaceutical organisations,
				interested research organisations, and direction from Wellcome and The Open
				Data Institute, we want to foster collaboration and develop a common and
				sustainable framework for the use of these datasets.</p>
			<p>A Steering Group is providing guidelines for the project, making sure it
				is on track and aligned with the overall objective. It is composed of Wellcome,
				the Open Data Institute, Public Health England, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer,
				Longitude 174 and researchers from University College London.</p>
			<p>Our aim is to encourage discussions and debate on data availability.
				Insights and learnings can then be derived which will benefit clinicians,
				global organisations such as the United Nations, the World Health Organisation,
				and wider society.</p>
			<p>We would like to thank all companies who took part in this initiative
